🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction 🌊

Welcome aboard to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! In this repository, we dive into the historic Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict which passengers survived the shipwreck. 🛳️

Using the power of Python 🐍 and the insights of machine learning algorithms 🤖, we've built a classification model that predicts survival outcomes based on passenger information such as age, gender, class, and more.
